# Persona
> Persona is in it's earliest stages of development, so we recommend that you check back in a few weeks or so. However, if you want to use it anyway, please note that documentation **is** incomplete and innaccurate, so for now, you're by yourself.

Persona is a modularized Discord userbot, created for those who need fast and customizable services in any Discord context.

## Installation
To build the bot, you will first need to install [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).
After you've done that, head over to the release page of this repository and download the latest release [here](https://github.com/rodofdiscord/persona/releases/latest).

Then, `cd` into the downloaded folder (after extracting) and run:
```
shards install
```

Finally, run:
```
crystal build src/persona.cr
```

A new file called `persona` should have appeared in the folder. Run it as an application using `./persona` (or any other preferred method) and the bot should start normally.
